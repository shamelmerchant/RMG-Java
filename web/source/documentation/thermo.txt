Estimating Species Thermochemistry
**********************************

The ``ThermoDataEstimator`` utility produces group additivity-based thermochemistry estimates without running RMG. As with the thermochemistry estimates used by RMG, the ``ThermoDataEstimator`` utility bases its estimates on group values located in the RMG database.

Instructions for Use
--------------------

1. Create a text file named :file:`input.txt` in any directory that you like.  
   The text file should begin with a block to specify a PrimaryThermoLibrary, which may be left empty if desired::

	PrimaryThermoLibrary:
	END

   Next, in the text file, create the adjacency list(s) corresponding to the molecule(s) of interest using the same syntax used to define a species in the :file:`condition.txt` input file (see RMG manual). Hydrogens can be omitted for simplicity. For example, the adjacency list for 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane could be written as::

	1 C 0 {2,S}
	2 C 0 {1,S} {3,S} {4,S} {5,S}
	3 C 0 {2,S}
	4 C 0 {2,S}
	5 C 0 {2,S} {6,S}
	6 C 0 {5,S} {7,S} {8,S} {9,S}
	7 C 0 {6,S}
	8 C 0 {6,S}
	9 C 0 {6,S}

2. At the command prompt, change directory to the location of the :file:`input.txt` file and then, if you are using a unix-based operating system, execute the command ::

	 $ java -classpath $RMG/bin/RMG.jar ThermoDataEstimator input.txt > RMG.log

   Or if you are using Windows operating system you can instead run the batch file :file:`ThermoDataEstimator.bat`. Either double-click it or at the command propmpt type::

     > ThermoDataEstimator.bat

  The output of the program will automatically be written to :file:`RMG.log`

3. The program will read RMG's thermodynamics database, count groups, and output the NASA polynomials in CHEMKIN format, as well as another set of values labeled ThermoData. The format for ThermoData is

	ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` S\ :sub:`298` C\ :sub:`p,300` C\ :sub:`p,400` C\ :sub:`p,500` C\ :sub:`p,600` C\ :sub:`p,800` C\ :sub:`p,1000` C\ :sub:`p,1500`

   Units are kcal/mol for ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` and cal/mol*K for the other quantities (entropy and heat capacity). The symmetry number (including contributions from internal rotations) will also be displayed.
