Representing oxygen
*******************

Special care should be taken when constructing a mechanism that involves 
molecular oxygen. The ground electronic state of molecular oxygen,
:math:`^3\Sigma^-_g`, does *not* contain a double bond, but instead a single
bond and two lone electrons. In RMG's adjaceny list notation the ground state
of oxygen is represented as ::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 1 {2,S}
  2 O 1 {1,S}

You should use the above adjacency list to represent molecular oxygen in
your condition files, seed mechanisms, etc. The triplet form is 22 kcal/mol
more stable than the first singlet excited state, :math:`^1\Delta_g`, which 
does contain a double bond. The adjacency list for singlet oxygen is ::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 0 {2,D}
  2 O 0 {1,D}

Selecting the correct structure for oxygen is important, as the reactions
generated from a double bond are significantly different than those generated
from a radical or diradical. For example, the reaction

.. math:: \mathrm{CH_4} + \mathrm{O_2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH_3} + \mathrm{HO_2}

would occur for both triplet and singlet oxygen, but in entirely different
families. For triplet oxygen the above represents a hydrogen abstraction, while
for singlet oxygen it represents the reverse of a disproportionation reaction.

Previous versions of RMG databases were ambiguous as to the treatment of
oxygen, with both ChemGraphs above representing ground-state oxygen. The
database provided with RMG 3.2 has been modified to make all of the
oxygen-related chemistry that was present in RMG databases consistent with the
single-bonded biradical representation.

Conversion between triplet and singlet forms is possible through the primary
reaction library ``OxygenSingTrip``; the reactions involved are very slow, however,
and are likely to be absent from any mechanisms generated. At this point, no other
reactions of singlet oxygen have been included in RMG.
