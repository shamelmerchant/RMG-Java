The seed mechanisms are stored in :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/kinetics_libraries/`


Currently, the reaction library that are included in RMG are: the Leeds' oxidation library 
the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism (w/o the nitrogen-containing species and the lumped C3H7 species)
and the Glarborg combustion mechanism for C1 - C3 species.

Glarborg
=========

RMG provides the option to use the rate coefficients in the master chemical
mechanism developed by Peter Glarborg and coworkers at the Technical University
of Denmark. The data are in the directory databases/kinetic_libraries/Glarborg.
Within this directory are four subdirectories -- C0, C1, C2, and C3 -- where
the index refers to the carbon number. The mechanisms are hierarchical in
nature, so the contents of C0 are contained in C1, C1 in C2, and so forth. The
C0 and C1 mechanisms include many small molecule reactions that would not
necessarily fit the reaction families of RMG; consequently, they are useful
Seed Mechanisms. The C2 and C3 mechanisms are optimized for high-temperature
oxidation, and many of the species in the C2 and C3 mechanisms are relevant
only for high-temperature chemistry. Therefore, if you are developing a
mechanism for low- or moderate-temperature oxidation, it is suggested that you
use C2 or C3 as a Primary Kinetic Library, rather than a Seed Mechanism.
Details of the mechanism can be obtained in these three papers and references
therein.
