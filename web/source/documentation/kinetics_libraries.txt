Kinetics Libraries
**********************************

The seed mechanisms are stored in :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/kinetics_libraries/`

Currently, the reaction libraries that are included in RMG are::
	
	the Leeds methane oxidation library
	the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism (w/o the nitrogen-containing species and the lumped C3H7 species)
	the Glarborg combustion mechanism for C1 - C3 species.

.. note::

	One or more species in these mechanisms would normally be forbidden by RMG, 
	which may lead you to get an error message like  "The molecular structure ...
	is forbidden by ...". To avoid this, use a 
	:ref:`Primary Thermodynamic Library <primarythermolibrary>` containing 
	the species, as this will make it allowed. (e.g. the DFT_QCI_thermo library).

Leeds methane oxidation library
===============================
The species and reactions contained in the :file:`combustion_core\\version5` directory
correspond to the Leeds methane oxidation mechanism, version 1.5: 
http://garfield.chem.elte.hu/Combustion/mechanisms/metan15.dat

	
GRI-Mech 3.0
============
The species and reactions contained in the GRI-Mech3.0 directory are those reported
in the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism, with the exception of the following species (and any
reaction they participate in)::
	
	Any nitrogen-containing species
	C3H7

RMG cannot currently handle nitrogen atoms, and the C3H7 species in the GRI-Mech 3.0
mechanism is a lumped species, meant to represent n- and iso-propyl radical; RMG
treats these two isomers as separate species.


Glarborg
=========

RMG provides the option to use the rate coefficients in the master chemical
mechanism developed by Peter Glarborg and coworkers at the Technical University
of Denmark. The data are in the directory databases/kinetic_libraries/Glarborg.
Within this directory are four subdirectories -- C0, C1, C2, and C3 -- where
the index refers to the carbon number. The mechanisms are hierarchical in
nature, so the contents of C0 are contained in C1, C1 in C2, and so forth. The
C0 and C1 mechanisms include many small molecule reactions that would not
necessarily fit the reaction families of RMG; consequently, they are useful
Seed Mechanisms. The C2 and C3 mechanisms are optimized for high-temperature
oxidation, and many of the species in the C2 and C3 mechanisms are relevant
only for high-temperature chemistry. Therefore, if you are developing a
mechanism for low- or moderate-temperature oxidation, it is suggested that you
use C2 or C3 as a Primary Kinetic Library, rather than a Seed Mechanism.

.. note::

	One set of kinetics in the Glarborg kinetic_library has been changed:
	**HO2 + OH = H2O + O2**.  The reason for the change is Glarborg uses the 
	summation of three sets	of modified Arrhenius parameters to reproduce their
	recommended rate coefficient.  However, one of the temperature-independent
	pre-exponential ("A") factors is negative, which neither RMG nor CHEMKIN
	can parse properly.  Instead, the kinetics of Baulch et al. 
	have been included.
