Introduction to RMG
*******************

RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator that constructs 
kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. The model parameters (rate constants 
and reaction thermodynamics) are estimated using a database and the idea that the 
behavior of functional groups is somewhat independent of the molecule(s) containing them. The RMG database consists of two parts: kinetic rate rules and 
thermodynamic group additivity values. 

RMG is an object-oriented program written in Java, which provides a stable, 
robust programming architecture that is easily extended, modified, and improved. 
At its core, RMG relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. The 
graphs represent the chemical structures, and the trees represent the databases of 
thermodynamic and kinetic data. Currently, RMG can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and its mechanisms 
can contain many hundreds of species and tens of thousands of reactions. It is 
also capable of performing first-order sensitivity analysis on the rate constants 
and species thermodynamics. 

RMG was originally developed by Dr. Jing Song under the guidance of Prof. William 
Green in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the `Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology <http://web.mit.edu/>`_. Currently there are several members of the Green group contributing to RMG's ongoing development. A full list of past and present RMG developers can be found on the :ref:`credits` page.

Changes
-------

Changes in RMG 3.2 include the following:

- The :file:`RMG_Database` folder has been restructured more logically. (:ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` and :ref:`Seed Mechanism <seedmechanism>` specifications in condition files will need updating)

- More accurate thermodynamic quantities from PM3 calculations for cyclic species based on explicit 3D molecule geometries (provided the user has access to GAUSSIAN03 or MOPAC2009)

- Transport property estimation

- New Reaction Library option for considering (but not forcing) reactions not automatically identified by RMG's reaction templates (The old Primary Reaction Library has been renamed to Primary Kinetic Library.)

- New reaction model pruning option to reduce number of edge species and ease memory limitations.

- New non-negativity option for DASSL simulations. This offers a new way of dealing with NegativeConcentrationException cases.

- New reaction family, 1,2-Birad_to_alkene, for interconversion of alkene (triplet) biradicals and singlet alkenes

- It is possible to specify :ref:`forbidden structures <forbiddenstructures>` in the input file.

- Various error messages have been improved to give more helpful information to the user.

- :file:`RMG_Dictionary.txt` will now be written at every iteration, rather than just the final iteration.

- CHEMKIN input files from each iteration are saved to separate folders

- RMG output file includes timestamp and code revision information.

- RMG stores :file:`Restart` files.  The reading-in of these files allows RMG to restore the conditions (species, reactions, pressure-dependent networks, etc.) of a converged mechanism without having to re-run the entire simulation from scratch.

- Treatment of molecular oxygen has changed significantly, including support for both triplet ground state and singlet; oxygen should now be specified in biradical form rather than the O=O form used previously; see :ref:`"Representing oxygen" <oxygen>` for details

- Various improvements to pressure-dependent network enlargement algorithm

- Fixed writing of reactions with Evans-Polanyi parameters to CHEMKIN input file

- Refinements to values in the database based on literature review.

- No longer falls into infinite loop when the simulation results in an invalid model but RMG cannot identify a suitable action to take to enlarge the model.

- Reservoir state method for evaluating pressure-dependent rate coefficients has been vetted and is now the recommended method for publication-quality models. The modified strong collision method remains available for preliminary exploration of reaction models.

- Pressure-dependence algorithm now defaults to an appropriate grid of temperatures and pressures based on the chosen interpolation model (e.g. Gauss-Chebyshev grid for Chebyshev polynomial model).

- Fixed several bugs relating to enlarging of partial pressure-dependent networks.

- Addressed issues that could lead to trying to simulate an empty reaction model in pressure-dependent cases.

- Fixed IWORK/RWORK renaming on Linux platforms.

- Fixed bug producing unneccessary error message (when using AUTO option) suggesting that the ODE solver failed when an edge flux exceeds user-specified tolerances at t=0.

- Fixed DASPK issues, including variables.dat renaming for multiple reaction systems, ability to use constant concentration, reaction flux evaluation for Lindemann reactions, and sensitivity coefficient calculation.

- Improved robustness for frequency estimation code ("frankie").

- Changed ODE Solver input file writing to use BufferedWriter to ease memory usage issues when using AUTO with large reaction models.

- Fixed a bug in counting pressure-dependent edge reactions with the AUTO method.

- Fixed calculation of Cp(T=0) and Cp(T=Infinity) for monoatomic and linear species.

- Addressed collider issues, including an ArrayOutOfBoundsException associated with colliders and a collider identification issue.

- Addressed infinite recursion error in getToEndOfAxis that could occur with cyclic cumulenic species.

- Fixed syntax for helium thermochemistry in CHEMKIN input file written by RMG.

- Fixed bugs in counting of core and edge reactions caused by pressure-dependent reactions and irreversible reactions.

- Primary Kinetics Library now correctly identifies matches for molecules with multiple resonance forms

Changes made in RMG 3.1 include the following:

- :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` and :ref:`PrimaryThermoLibrary <primarythermolibrary>`  now both behave as reference libraries from which data are taken (in preference to group additivity estimates), when and if the data are needed.

- :ref:`Seed Mechanism <seedmechanism>` allows the mechanism building to start from a seed mechanism, which is included in its entirety before the simulation starts. (This is how :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` behaved in previous releases.)

- New databases: GRIMech 3.0 and PrIMe-recommended thermodynamic values are included

- Support for Chemkin's P-Log format for :ref:`k(T,P) reporting <pressuredependence>`  (in addition to Chebyshev format).

- Added additional options for the input file, including:

    - User-specified limits for number of carbon / oxygen / radical per species
 
    - User-specified Chebyshev fitting options

- Changed many dependent Fortran codes to use standard input and output, rather than writing temporary files to disk.

- Reduced run-to-run variations by standardizing the order of averaging of values in the kinetics trees.

Bug Fixes:

- Corrected inconsistencies in edge flux evaluation for pressure-dependent reactions.

- Corrected an error in inert gas normalization for runs with multiple temperatures/pressures

- Fixed DASPK interface

- Fixed bugs in peroxide (ROOR) frequency estimation

- Fixed a bug in the gauche correction database for alkenes

- Fixed issues with duplicate reactions and with Chebyshev fitting in writing CHEMKIN input files

- More frequent garbage collection


Changes made in RMG 3.0 include the following:

New features:

- Pressure-dependent reaction network generation

- InChI generation

- Graphical user interface for input file generation

- Generation of reaction mechanisms for multiple reaction conditions (T,P)

- Automatic time stepping option

- Updated RMG Viewer and Editor (including database editing tools)

Functionality changes:

- On the first step of mechanism generation, only one species is added, rather than adding all edge species

- Thermodynamics estimates for non-cyclic species incorporate certain steric effects (1,5-interactions and gauche interactions)

Bug fixes:

- Fixed bug in symmetry number generation (previously could be underestimated in certain cases)

- Fixed differential equations to correctly treat cases where total number of moles changes
