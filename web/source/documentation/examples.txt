Minimal Example
========================

This is a minimal example and should run quickly. It does not include any 
calculation of pressure-dependent reaction rates.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/RMG/minimal/condition.txt


1,3-hexadiene pyrolysis
========================

This is our first example. Somebody should write something wise about it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/RMG/1,3-hexadiene/condition.txt


Butane oxidation with pruning
=============================

This example illustrates the use of pruning, as well
as multiple reaction conditions. The example should
take at least several hours to run and may require allocation
of a large amount of memory (e.g. 1500 MB) to complete:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/RMG/butane_pruning/condition.txt


Quantum mechanics calculations
================================

This is an example illustrating the use of on-the-fly thermo
calculations. Gaussian03 is used to estimate thermodynamic
properties of cyclic species, like cyclopropane. In particular,
the semi-empirical PM3 method, with RRHO treatment of partition
functions is used. Without this feature, RMG would try to estimate
thermodynamic properties of cyclic species using the typical Benson
groups, and would only apply an appropriate ad hoc ring correction
if it is in Ring_Library.txt. The example should take roughly 45
minutes to run and requires several additional dependencies, as
described in the documentation.
