Latest Developer version
------------------------

To get the latest development version of the source code (the head of the official master branch) 
you can download a snapshot from 
http://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/archives/master
or use either git or SVN for read-only access:

* git clone git://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java.git
* svn checkout \http://svn.github.com/greengroup/RMG-Java.git

If you might want to make changes, a better idea is to create your own account on github.com, 
fork the official repository (http://github.com/greengroup/RMG-Java), and clone that. 
There's help at http://help.github.com/

For help compiling, please refer to the :ref:`compiling_from_source` section of the documentation.
